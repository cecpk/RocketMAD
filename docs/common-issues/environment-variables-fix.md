# Windows ENV Fix

A common error is:

```
'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
```

or:

```
'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
```

Luckily for you, this error is easy to solve!

## What's wrong:

Windows defines commands in something called "environment variables", if a program isn't here, Windows doesn't know where to find what you're asking for.

## How to solve this:

If you install python, it can automatically set the correct environment variables. However, if you didn't enable this feature, you need to do it manually.

## How to set them manually:

Step 1]	Press the Windows Key + Pause/Break (Or right click on "This PC" and select properties)

Step 5] Close all windows by pressing "OK" and restart the command prompt, now everything should be working fine!
