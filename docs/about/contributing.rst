Adding or Editing Pages
************************

A few guidelines to help keep things clean and organized...

Keep filenames short and to the point, for example: ``installation.rst``

Always begin your new page with a title:

.. code-block:: rst

  Awesome Wiki Page
  ################

Titles will be shown at the top of a page and in the site navigation. A title should describe a page in a glance. The rest of the file is written in ReST or Markdown structured text. Here is a `cheatsheet`_ for RST formatting, and one for `markdown`_.

Once done editing your page, add it under one of the ``toctree`` sections in ``index.rst``.

Now to preview your changes, open a terminal, go into the ``docs`` directory and use ``make clean-auto auto``. This will start a local webserver with live updates pages as you save them.

Finally, when you are finished, submit your changes as a Pull Request to be reviewed.
