Welcome to RocketMAD's Documentation!
=========================================

RocketMAD gives you a map with nearby Pokémon, PokéStops, Gyms, and much more in the form of a web-app as well as a native phone application.
It visualizes data scanned by `MAD <https://github.com/Map-A-Droid/MAD>`_. RocketMAD does not work as standalone and the code has been heavily modified to only work with MAD. This frontend is based on `RocketMap <https://github.com/RocketMap/RocketMap>`_.
